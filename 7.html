        <br>According to a report published together by Oxfam, Amnesty International, and the
        International Action Network on Small Arms(IANSA) in 2006, there are around 40
        million illegal small arms in India. This would mean that India had over half
        of the small arms in the entire world (the world had 75 million).

        Most of the illegal small arms end up in the states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh,
        Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh.[7] In India, an used
        AK-47 costs $3,800 on the illegal black market.[8] But a large amount of
        illegal small arms are made in illegal arms factories in Uttar Pradesh
        and Bihar, and sold on the black market for as little as $5.08.

        Chinese pistols are in demand in the illegal small arms market in India
        because they are easy to get and cheaper.[7] This creates a major problem
        for the states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Orissa,
        Maharashtra, West Bengal, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. These states are
        affected by Naxalism.Naxalites are groups of Communist guerrilla fighters
        in India. (Guerrilla fighters are people who attack a regular army.)
        Many Chinese pistols, AK-47s, and M-16 rifles are smuggled into India through
        the border between India and Nepal. These weapons are then used by the Naxalites.
