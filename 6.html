            <h1>Illegal drug trade</h1>
            India is located between the Golden Crescent(made of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran)
            and the Golden Triangle (made of Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos).

            India is the world's largest maker of legal opium.
            But its opium gets diverted (taken away by drug traffickers)
            to other countries where opium and heroin are illegal.
            India is a common starting point for drug traffickers who
            take heroin on ships from Southwest Asian countries like
            Afghanistan and Pakistan, and from Southeast Asian
            countries like Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand.The heroin is
            then smuggled from Pakistan and Myanmar.
            Most heroin shipped from India goes to Europe. There have
            been reports of heroin smuggled from Mumbai to Nigeria to
            get the drugs to more countries.
